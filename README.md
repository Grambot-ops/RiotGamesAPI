## üöÄ Development

The source is written in **[C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) 4.0** with **[.NET](https://github.com/dotnet) Framework 4.0** and **[WinForms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)** using **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) 2010**.

## üé® Structure :

- :open_file_folder: **RiotGamesAPI**:
  - :page_facing_up: **ApiConnection**: Setups a connection to the API.
  - :page_facing_up: **ApiMethod**: Abstract class for using an API method.
  - :page_facing_up: **Utilities**: Usefull methodes for dealing with some types of data used.
  - :file_folder: **API**: Classes for using all api available API methods.
  - :file_folder: **DTO**: Classes for holding all kinds of JSON data objects returned by the API methods.

## üìù How to use ?
Learn by a simpe example: Getting a summoner informations.<br/>
To get summoner data, we use the **SummonerV3** API.

1. Setup a connection to the API using your **API Key** and choosing a **region** :
```csharp
string apiKey = "RGAPI-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx";
ApiConnection apiConnection = new apiConnection(apiKey, ApiConnection.RegionCode.euw1);
```
2. Setup an instance of **SummonerV3** using the created connection :
```csharp
SummonerV3 summonerApi = new SummonerV3(apiConnection);
```
3. Use the SummonerV3 API method **GetSummonerBySummonerName** to get a **SummonerDTO** object containing the retrieved data :
```csharp
SummonerDTO summonerData = summonerApi.GetSummonerBySummonerName(summonerName);
```
4. The retrieved summoner data can now be used through the SummonerDTO object :
```csharp
string message = "The level of this summoner is " + summonerData.SummonerLevel;
```
